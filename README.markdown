# unnamed YUIDoc theme


The generated docs use jQuery 1.4.2 (linked from the HTML) as well as some
Google-served webfonts (also linked).

## Installation / Usage

I guess you've got YUIDoc up and running at this point. Just [download](#)
this here theme, unpack it, and point `yuidoc.py` to it using the script's
`-t/--template` option.


## Example

Here's the original YUI documentation in its [original look](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/index.html).

And here is it generated using [UNNAMED YUIDOC THEME](#).


## Acknowledgements

My thanks go to the [YUIDoc](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yuidoc/) guys,
obviously. The original templates might be a bit <del>shitty</del> unorthodox
in their indention and cleanliness, but the overall system is good.  ;)

Also, thanks to my good friend [Mike West](http://mikewest.org/), web dev
extraordinaire, who [forked the original
YUIDoc](http://github.com/mikewest/yuidoc) and added Markdown support. Big
ups, playa!
